# End-to-End Machine Learning Projects  

This repository contains multiple end-to-end machine learning projects.  
Each project folder is independent and demonstrates the full ML pipeline (data preprocessing, training, evaluation, etc.).  

## Key Point
All codes include **detailed comments**.  
My goal is to make sure that even a **complete beginner** can follow the logic at a glance and understand how the project works.  

## Structure
- Each folder corresponds to a different ML project.  
- You can open any folder, read the code, and learn step by step.  
- The list of projects will **continue to grow** over time.  

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo or download it.  
2. Open any project folder in your editor (e.g., VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm).  
3. Run the code and follow the inline comments to understand each step.

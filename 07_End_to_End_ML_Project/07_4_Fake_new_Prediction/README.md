\### Fake News Prediction`n`nThis project aims to predict whether a news article is real or fake based on its content. The model uses the \*\*TfidfVectorizer\*\* to convert the text data into numerical features and then trains a machine learning classifier to make predictions.`n`n#### Dataset`nThe dataset used in this project includes the following features:`n\* `id`: A unique ID for each news article.`n\* `title`: The title of the news article.`n\* `author`: The author of the news article.`n\* `text`: The full text of the article; could be incomplete.`n\* `label`: A binary label indicating if the news is fake (`1`) or real (`0`).`n`n#### Current Status`n`n`n`nMy next step is to fix the `NotFittedError` by ensuring the `TfidfVectorizer` is properly trained before it is used for prediction. I will then complete the model training and evaluation process.`n`nOnce these issues are resolved, I will update the project with the full prediction results and a more detailed analysis." | Out-File -FilePath README.md -Encoding utf8

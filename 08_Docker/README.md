# 🤖 Simple Chatbot with Docker

This project is a simple chatbot built with **Flask** and **HuggingFace Transformers**.
It provides a minimal web interface where users can send messages and get instant replies.

## 🐳 What is Docker?

**Docker** is a platform that lets you run software inside **portable containers**.

* A container = a small package that includes the app + its dependencies + environment settings.
* This solves the “it works on my machine but not on yours” problem.
* Applications run the same way across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Container vs Virtual Machine (VM)

* **VM:** Emulates an entire operating system → heavy, slow to boot.
* **Container:** Isolates only what’s needed for the app → lightweight, fast, resource-efficient.

👉 In short: Docker = **a guarantee your app runs the same everywhere**.

## 🚀 Why Docker?

* One-command setup & execution
* Portability across environments
* Isolated runtime
* No dependency/version conflicts

There are hundreds of “ML Roadmaps” and endless link collections across the internet.
While they can be useful, they often look overwhelming at first sight.

This repository was created to **make Machine Learning easier to follow**:

* 👉 Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks covering essential topics
* 👉 Practical, working examples instead of just theory or links
* 👉 Continuously updated with new content and projects

## 💡 About Roadmaps

You’ve probably seen roadmap images like the one below. Yes, they look huge and maybe even intimidating.
But remember: **getting started is always the most important step.**
With small, consistent progress, everything starts to make sense.
